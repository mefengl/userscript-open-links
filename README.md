> Simple reimplementation of the Chrome extension [Linkclump](https://github.com/benblack86/linkclump) as a userscript version

> You may find that it doesn't work well on some websites, such as Github, if you use Safari's Tampermonkey extension. I still don't know why, but I found [Stay](https://github.com/shenruisi/Stay) to be effective. I wonder if this is because they request different permissions. I have reported this issue to Tampermonkey and any help with this matter would be appreciated.

> If you use Chrome, original extension is recommended.

## How to use

If you know how to use Linkclump, you know how to use this script.

Don't implement all features Linkclump has, Contributions welcome.

## Why I create it

I created it because I needed it in Safari, and many other people need it too:
